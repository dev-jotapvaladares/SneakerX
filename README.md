<h1>SneakerX</h1>

<p>
  SneakerX is a project that uses HTML, CSS and Javascript to create a page (based on the famous StockX, but not a clone). </br>
  The page is extremely modern and has transition elements and sliders. Its concept surpasses that of other real pages that offer this same type of service.
